I'm a system security researcher at ETH Zurich, focusing on operating system kernels, with an emphasis on Linux. 
The fundamental goal of my research is to improve the correctness of OS kernels, one of the most complicated software, via finding and eliminating the bugs with the approaches called *fuzz testing* and *symbolic execution*.

I designed and implemented a kernel fuzzer called [Healer](https://github.com/SunHao-0/healer), which is open-sourced and has found more than 100 bugs in Linux. 
This work was accepted by [**SOSP '21**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483547).
My recent work KSG, a kernel specification generator, has led to the discovery of 23 bugs in Linux and was accepted by **ATC '22**.
Besides, I'm also interested in system works and the idea of redesigning the software stack with current security and privacy concerns in mind is fascinating to me.
